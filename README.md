# Music-Database
An application for users to add songs, remove songs, or get songs from a database. Uses a hashtable and chaining to store the songs.

- SongsList.txt contains the lists of songs to add as a song object into the hashtable
- LinksList.txt contains the link of every song in the song object.
 
 To get the program running, run the front end file with all the files in the source folder in the same filepath.
 The program provides the following functions:
  1. Find a song given the song name
  2. Check if the artist exists
  3. Add a song
  4. Remove a song
  5. Print out all songs in the database
  6. Print number of songs in the database
  7. Clear a song
